        Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of writing computer programs using
        "objects" to stand for data and methods. Computer programs that are not
        object-oriented are a list of instructions for the computer, telling it to do
        certain things in a certain way, which is called procedural programming. However,
        in object-oriented programming, computer programs use objects that talk to one
        another to change the data in those objects and to work in a way that the user
        wants. Because of the way object-oriented programming is designed, it helps the
        developer by allowing for code to be easily reused by other parts of the program
        or even by other people. Most programming languages are a mix of different ways
        of writing computer programs. For example, Python allows for computer programs
        be written both in object-oriented programming and in procedural programming.
        There are many programming languages that allow you to write computer programs
        in object-oriented programming. Some of these programming languages are: C++, Java,
        Ruby, Perl, Emarald, Sapphire, PHP, Python, C#, etc.
